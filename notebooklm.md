What is NotebookLM?

An AI-powered tool from Google that acts as a research and writing assistant.

Helps users analyze and interact with their own documents.

Users can upload various files or link to sources, and then ask questions or request
summaries that are grounded in that specific content.

Upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs, Google Slides and
more, and NotebookLM will summarize them and make interesting connections between
topics, all powered by the latest version of Gemini's multimodal understanding
capabilities.

Upload lecture recordings, textbook chapters, and research papers. Ask NotebookLM to
explain complex concepts in simple terms, provide real-world examples, and reinforce
your understanding.

Upload your source material and let NotebookLM create a polished presentation outline,
complete with key talking points and supporting evidence.

NotebookLM is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather
together multiple "sources" - documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube
videos - into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them.
Under the hood it's powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM.
