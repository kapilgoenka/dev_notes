This file started out as the .zshrc file on my local dev machine (mac). To understand
it better, I decided to elaborate how each line in the file got there and what it
meant. Along the way, the file has evolved to be primarily my dev-notes file where I
am documenting my learnings about Python, AI etc.

File structure:
Top-level sections have four rows of #s before & after the section title
With the top-level sections, sub-sections have one row of #s before / after the title
