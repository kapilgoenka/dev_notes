https://medium.com/@hmbarotov/configuring-a-django-project-with-uv-548f15ccbc63

   uv init --package django_uv

   uv add django

   uv add --dev django-debug-toolbar

   uv add --group prod gunicorn

   uv sync

   uv run django-admin startproject django_project .

   To complete the project setup, you need to create the tables associated with the
   models of the default Django applications included in the INSTALLED_APPS setting.

   By applying the initial migrations, the tables for the applications listed in the
   INSTALLED_APPS setting are created in the database.

   uv run manage.py migrate

   uv run manage.py runserver

   uv run manage.py startapp books
